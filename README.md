# Data Science Programming with Python
## Decision Tree
Decision tree coded with Python. The interface of the decision tree class is designed to be compatible with sk-learn. The decision tree is tested with iris dataset.


## Regression
Various linear regressions for multi variables and L1 and L2 regulizations are coded using python numpy vectors and matrices. The following figure shows a polynomial fitting without regulization.

## Logistic Regression
The implementation of logistic regression, L1 and L2 regulizations and gradient descent using python numpy matrix and vector. Logistic regression is used to evaluate the probability of a binary outcome using input variables. For example, binary logistic regression can be used to classify a Donut dataset.

## Classification of Facial Expression
Comparison of various classifiers applied to the facial recognition data from the Kaggle facial expression recognition challenge
https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge. 
Seven categories of facial expressions are classified: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.

## Classification of E-commerce web data data
Five category class of the E-commerce data is classified using logistic regression and various implementations of neural networks using Pure Numpy, Sklearn, or Tensorflow. 

## Neural Networks
Implementation of Neural Network, L1 and L2 regulizations and gradient descent using Python numpy matrix.

## Scikit-Learn examples
Solving machine learning problems using the scikit learn package. Scikit-learn can dramatically simplify many tasks of machine learning. Thus, these examples are relatively simple compared with algorithms implmented with Python.
